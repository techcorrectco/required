# Requirements Document: Claude Code Requirements Management Tool

## Project Overview

A Claude Code tool that transforms natural language feature descriptions into structured requirements using markdown templates, then generates code implementations with complete traceability and documentation feedback loops.

## Core Feature Requirements

- Follow ASD-STE100 language structure rules
- Create comprehensive acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Include negative criteria (what NOT to implement)
- Determine parent-child relationships through semantic analysis
- Present generated files for user review using Claude Code preview format
- Save approved files to `requires/requirements/[ID].md`

### REQ-3: Intelligent Parent Detection
The system SHALL analyze existing requirements to determine appropriate parent relationships for new requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Read all existing requirement files to understand current hierarchy
- Maintain single top-level requirement constraint
- Compare new requirements with existing ones using semantic similarity
- Identify domain relationships (authentication, payments, data access)
- Suggest appropriate parent assignments
- Auto-increment IDs within existing structure
- Ensure logical hierarchy organization

### REQ-4: Implementation Planning and Design
The system SHALL create detailed implementation plans before code generation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Execute via `/requires design [REQUIREMENT-ID]` command
- Read requirement file from `requires/requirements/[ID].md`
- Analyze existing codebase structure and patterns
- Read CLAUDE.md files for technical context
- Generate technical approach and architecture recommendations
- Identify files needing creation or modification
- Create ordered implementation steps
- Assess technical risks and dependencies
- Plan integration with existing systems
- Analyze CLAUDE.md documentation for gaps
- Provide specific documentation improvement recommendations
- Save implementation plan to `requires/designs/[ID].md`
- Update requirement status to `designed`

### REQ-5: Code Implementation with Traceability
The system SHALL generate code implementations that exactly meet requirement acceptance criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Execute via `/requires implement [REQUIREMENT-ID]` command
- Read requirement from `requires/requirements/[ID].md`
- Read implementation plan from `requires/designs/[ID].md`
- Generate code meeting ONLY specified acceptance criteria
- Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
- Use specified existing utilities and classes
- Include comprehensive test coverage referencing requirement ID
- Create git commits with descriptive messages referencing requirement
- Update requirement status to `implemented ([commit-hash1], [commit-hash2])`
- Provide optional documentation feedback for gaps encountered
- Ensure complete traceability from requirement to code

### REQ-6: Requirement Updates with Impact Analysis
The system SHALL update existing requirements while analyzing cascade impacts on related requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Execute via `/requires update [REQUIREMENT-ID] "new text"` command
- Read existing requirement and parse current relationships
- Apply semantic versioning based on change impact (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Analyze impact on parent requirements
- Analyze impact on child requirements
- Analyze impact on dependent requirements
- Analyze impact on sibling requirements
- Identify requirements NOT affected
- Present specific change recommendations for affected requirements
- Ask user confirmation for cascade updates
- Update requirement file with new content and incremented version
- Update design plan if it exists

### REQ-7: Markdown Template Management
The system SHALL use standardized markdown templates for all requirement files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Include structured frontmatter with metadata
- Auto-generate all frontmatter fields (ID, title, type, status, parent, dependencies, conflicts, timestamps, author, version)
- Include requirement statement with RFC-2119 compliance
- Include business rationale explaining value
- Include comprehensive acceptance criteria with implementation boundaries
- Maintain consistent formatting across all files
- Support semantic versioning in version field
- Track status changes through command execution

### REQ-8: File Organization and Structure
The system SHALL organize all files in a logical, scalable directory structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Use `requires/requirements/` for requirement markdown files
- Use `requires/designs/` for implementation plan files
- Maintain parallel file naming (same ID, different directories)
- Support hierarchical requirement organization
- Enable easy navigation between related files
- Support git version control workflows
- Maintain clean separation between requirements and design documents

### REQ-9: Quality Assurance and Validation
The system SHALL enforce quality standards and validate requirement completeness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Enforce exactly one RFC-2119 keyword per requirement
- Validate acceptance criteria completeness
- Check for circular dependencies
- Ensure parent-child relationships are valid
- Apply ASD-STE100 language structure rules
- Validate semantic versioning rules
- Provide quality feedback and improvement suggestions
- Ensure hierarchical consistency

### REQ-10: Command Line Interface
The system SHALL provide a unified command line interface for all operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement single `/requires` command with multiple modes
- Support feature description mode: `/requires "feature text"`
- Support design mode: `/requires design [ID]`
- Support implementation mode: `/requires implement [ID]`
- Support update mode: `/requires update [ID] "new text"`
- Provide clear error messages and usage instructions
- Follow standard CLI patterns and conventions
- Route to appropriate prompts based on arguments

### REQ-11: Documentation Feedback Loop
The system SHALL provide feedback on CLAUDE.md documentation quality to improve future implementations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Analyze CLAUDE.md files during design phase
- Identify missing technical documentation
- Detect outdated information contradicting current code
- Suggest specific improvements with concrete examples
- Recommend new documentation sections where gaps exist
- Provide targeted feedback during implementation if gaps remain
- Support continuous improvement of documentation quality
- Help maintain current and accurate technical context

### REQ-12: Version Control Integration
The system SHALL integrate seamlessly with git version control workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generate commit messages referencing requirement IDs
- Create meaningful commit descriptions linking to acceptance criteria
- Support multiple commits per requirement implementation
- Track commit hashes in requirement status
- Enable bidirectional traceability (requirement â†” commits)
- Work within existing project git repositories
- Support standard git workflows and branching strategies
