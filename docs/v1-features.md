# Feature Descriptions for Claude Code Requirements Tool

These are the natural language feature descriptions you would input to the `/requires` command to generate the structured requirements.

## Feature 1: Project Setup and Initialization
```
/requires "Project initialization system that sets up requirements management directory structure and installs Claude Code integration. Users run a single command to create organized directories for requirements and design files, and enable the requirements management workflow in their project."
```

## Feature 2: Requirements Generation from Natural Language
```
/requires "Feature analysis and requirements generation system that transforms natural language feature descriptions into structured markdown requirements. The system reads existing requirements to maintain hierarchy, applies language standards, generates comprehensive acceptance criteria, and creates organized requirement files with proper relationships and dependencies."
```

## Feature 3: Implementation Planning and Design
```
/requires "Implementation planning system that analyzes requirements and creates detailed technical design plans before code generation. The system reads requirements and existing codebase, generates technical approaches, identifies file changes, assesses risks, and provides documentation improvement recommendations to ensure successful implementation."
```

## Feature 4: Code Generation with Traceability
```
/requires "Code implementation system that generates working code from requirements and design plans with complete traceability. The system reads requirements and design files, generates code meeting exact acceptance criteria, creates comprehensive tests, commits changes with proper messages, and links implementations back to requirements through commit tracking."
```

## Feature 5: Requirement Updates and Impact Analysis
```
/requires "Requirement update system that modifies existing requirements while analyzing cascade impacts on related requirements. The system updates requirement content, applies semantic versioning, analyzes effects on parent and child requirements, identifies dependency impacts, and provides recommendations for maintaining consistency across the requirement hierarchy."
```

## Feature 6: Quality Standards and Validation
```
/requires "Quality assurance system that enforces standards and validates requirement completeness. The system applies RFC-2119 compliance, enforces language structure rules, validates acceptance criteria completeness, checks dependency relationships, and ensures hierarchical consistency across all requirements."
```

## Feature 7: Documentation Management and Feedback
```
/requires "Documentation feedback system that analyzes and improves technical documentation quality throughout the development process. The system reviews existing documentation, identifies gaps and outdated information, provides specific improvement recommendations, and maintains accurate technical context for code generation."
```

## Feature 8: Command Interface and User Experience
```
/requires "Unified command line interface that provides clean access to all requirements management operations. The system supports multiple command modes through a single interface, provides clear usage patterns, handles different argument types, and integrates seamlessly with Claude Code's existing infrastructure."
```

## Usage Instructions

Copy each feature description (the text inside the quotes after `/requires`) and input it into your requirements tool to generate the structured requirements. Then compare the generated output against the requirements document to verify:

1. **Proper requirement breakdown** - Features split into appropriate atomic requirements
2. **Correct hierarchy** - Parent-child relationships and ID structure  
3. **Complete acceptance criteria** - All functionality captured with implementation boundaries
4. **Quality standards** - RFC-2119 compliance and language structure
5. **Relationship analysis** - Dependencies and conflicts identified correctly

This will validate that your tool can successfully transform natural language into the structured requirements we designed.
